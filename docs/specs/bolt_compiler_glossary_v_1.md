# üß† Bolt Compiler Glossary and Terminology (v1.3 ‚Äî Aligned with Bolt Language v2.3)

This glossary aligns the compiler‚Äôs terminology with **Bolt Language v2.3**. All identifiers are full words (no underscores or hyphens). ‚ÄúIR‚Äù is spelled out as **Bolt Intermediate Representation**. System‚Äëcall wording follows language spec (User System Request Entry; Kernel System Request Identifier). Attribute names mirror the language‚Äôs **bracketed attributes** (lowerCamelCase).

# Complete Definition List (every compiler term and what it does)

### Program Representation
