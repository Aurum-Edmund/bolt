# ⚡ Bolt Language Glossary and Syntax Reference (v2.3 — Air Format, Kernel-Ready)

This edition defines **bracketed attributes** (square-bracket attributes placed above declarations), locks the **Bolt Intermediate Representation** term, **bans underscores and hyphens in language identifiers**, and uses **full words** everywhere. It is the canonical reference for freestanding or kernel builds.

---

## Attribute Syntax (Formal)
**Style rule:** Language identifiers MUST avoid underscores `_` and hyphens `-`. Use single words or **lowerCamelCase** for identifiers and attributes. No brand-specific terminology is used.

**Placement:** Place attributes on the line immediately **above** a declaration (function, blueprint or field, variable). Multiple lines of attributes are allowed; order is preserved.

**Grammar (EBNF):**
```
Attributes      := { AttributeLine }
AttributeLine   := '[' Attribute { ',' Attribute } ']'
Attribute       := Identifier [ '(' ArgumentList ')' ]
ArgumentList    := Argument { ',' Argument }
Argument        := Identifier '=' Value | Value
Value           := Integer | Text | Identifier
Identifier      := letter { letter | digit }
```
**Rules:**
- Duplicate attributes are an error unless the attribute is explicitly **repeatable** (none are repeatable in v2.3).
- Unknown attributes are an error in the **freestanding** profile and a warning in the **hosted** profile.

**Supported attributes (v2.3, lowerCamelCase):**
- `interruptHandler`
- `bareFunction`
- `inSection(name: text)`
- `aligned(bytes: integer)`
- `pageAligned`
- `packed`
- `bits(width: integer)` (field only)
- `systemRequest(identifier: integer)`
- `intrinsic(name: text)`

**Attribute placement (Stage‑0 enforcement)**
| Attribute | Allowed on | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| `interruptHandler` | `function` | Kernel profile only; emits interrupt-friendly prologue/epilogue. |
| `bareFunction` | `function` | Removes generated prologue/epilogue; mutually exclusive with `interruptHandler`. |
| `inSection` | `function` | Places the symbol into a specific linker section (for example `.text.boot`). |
| `aligned` | `function` | Enforces minimum alignment (power of two). |
| `pageAligned` | `function` | Convenience shorthand for current architecture page size. |
| `systemRequest` | `function` | Marks user-to-kernel gateway entry; requires kernel profile. |
| `intrinsic` | `function` | Requests a named backend-defined intrinsic expansion. |
| `packed` | `blueprint` | Removes padding from the layout (required for MMIO device blocks). |
| `aligned` | `blueprint` | Overrides layout alignment when not using `packed`. |
| `bits` | `blueprint` field | Requires containing blueprint to be `packed`; sets exact bit width. |
| `aligned` | `blueprint` field | Overrides field-level alignment within the packed structure. |

> Stage‑0 tooling must treat any attribute outside its allowed context as an error in freestanding builds.

**Examples**
```bolt
[interruptHandler]
public integer function timerInterrupt() { /* ... */ }

[bareFunction]
[inSection(".text.boot"), aligned(4096)]
public integer function earlyEntry() { assembly { "cli"; "hlt"; } }

[systemRequest(identifier=1)]
public live integer function systemWrite(integer fileDescriptor, pointer<byte> buffer, unsigned64 length);

public live integer function example(integer value) {
    integer next = value + 1;
    return next;
}

[packed]
public blueprint UartControl {
    [bits(1)] unsignedInteger enable;
    [bits(2)] unsignedInteger parity;
    [bits(2)] unsignedInteger stopBits;
    [bits(27)] unsignedInteger reserved;
}
```

## Numeric Type Aliases
- integer is the default signed thirty-two bit scalar (alias for integer32).
## Memory Model and live value
**live value (volatile):**
- Front-end analysis records live qualifiers alongside type metadata so MIR/LIR passes can honour ordering and visibility guarantees.
loat64.
- Use explicit width forms (for example, integer16, integer64, loat32) when exact sizing or interop requirements demand it.
- Compiler diagnostics and canonical MIR output prefer the alias form unless a width-specific type is declared.
- Documentation snippets may present the shorthand public integer function sample(integer value) { ... } to illustrate the alias while the Stage-0 parser continues to accept unction sample(...) -> integer.

## Calling Conventions (x86-64, long-pointer sixty-four data model, kernel profile)
**Default `function` (System V AMD64):**
- **Arguments (left to right):** RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9, then stack.
- **Return:** RAX (and RDX for one hundred twenty-eight bit values where applicable).
- **Callee saved:** RBX, RBP, R12 to R15.
- **Caller saved:** RAX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, R8 to R11.
- **Stack:** sixteen-byte aligned at call; the red zone is **disabled** in the kernel.

**`[interruptHandler]` functions:**
- Prologue and epilogue save and restore the full interrupt frame; returns with `iretq`.
- The direction flag is cleared.
- Segment state and stack alignment are restored by the epilogue.

**`[bareFunction]`:**
- No prologue or epilogue is emitted; the caller must establish alignment and save registers.

**`[systemRequest(identifier = N)]` (User System Request Entry):**
- Emits the `syscall` instruction with the **Kernel System Request Identifier** in RAX; other registers follow the kernel Application Binary Interface contract.

> Note: Register names (RAX, RDI, and so on) are hardware names and may retain uppercase letters.

---

## Memory Model and Live Value
**Atomic ordering (per operation):** `relaxed`, `acquire`, `release`, `acquireRelease`, `sequentiallyConsistent`.
- Fences: `memoryFence(order)`; the optimizer may not remove a fence or move instructions across it.
- Lock-free widths: one, two, four, and eight bytes are lock-free on x86-64.

**Live Value (volatile):**
- Loads and stores are side-effecting; they are never removed or merged across fences.
- Reordering across **packed** memory-mapped input/output blueprint fields is forbidden; the compiler must respect program order.
- Front-end analysis records Live qualifiers alongside type metadata so MIR/LIR passes can honour ordering and visibility guarantees.

---

## Link Placement and Alignment Rules
- `inSection(".name")` sets the symbol’s **primary** output section.
- `aligned(N)` enforces a minimum alignment; if `pageAligned` is also present, the **greater** alignment wins.
- Conflicts (for example, multiple `inSection` or multiple `aligned`) are errors.
- Module-wide defaults (via a build script or a profile) apply **only** when no per-symbol attribute is present.

---

## Error Handling and Runtime Policy (Kernel)
- **Exceptions:** disabled. Any `try` or `catch` is a compile-time error in the freestanding profile.
- **Panic policy:** `panic abort` — immediate trap; no unwinding.
- **Assertions:**
  - Debug kernel: trap with file, line, and message.
  - Release kernel: removed unless explicitly compiled with `--assert=keep`.
- **No hidden allocation:** Formatting, `match`, and standard helpers are allocation-free in freestanding builds. Any implicit allocation is a compile-time error.

---

## Build Profiles and Required Flags
Freestanding or kernel builds **must** enable the following flags:
```
--freestanding --no-runtime --no-stdlib \
--panic=abort --exceptions=off \
--rtti=off --reflection=off \
--bounds=off   # enable in debug with --bounds=on
```

Optional in-source profile header:
```bolt
profile kernelFreestanding {
    panic abort
    exceptions off
    bounds off
    rtti off
    reflection off
}
```
