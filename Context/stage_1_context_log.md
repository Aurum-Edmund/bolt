# Stage-1 Context Log

## Current Milestone
- **S1-M0 (Planning):** Expand the high-level IR type system and propagate metadata into MIR to unblock backend work.

## Progress Summary
- Stage-0 deliverables archived; SSA conversion, linker automation, and runtime helpers are available as a foundation for Stage-1.
- Task board for Stage-1 created to capture type-system, backend scaffolding, runtime, and diagnostic expansion workstreams.
- Verified local `master` alignment with `work` and reran the full Stage-0 test suite to confirm a clean baseline ahead of Stage-1 execution.

## Progress Metric
- **Estimated Stage-1 completion:** 0%

## Pending Tasks
- Prioritise high-level IR type-system expansion items for implementation order.
- Outline backend scaffolding spikes (instruction selection tables, allocator prototype) and resource owners.
- Refine runtime/linker milestones for freestanding image production, leveraging Stage-0 automation.
- Identify diagnostic gaps to grow parser/binder negative suites and MIR goldens.

## Notes
- Stage-0 context retained under `Context/archive/stage_0_context_log.md` for historical reference.
- Task tracking for Stage-1 lives in `../Taskboard/bolt_compiler_task_board_stage1.md`.
- Continue enforcing Bolt naming rules (full words, lowerCamelCase attributes) and run tests with `cmake --preset build-windows-release` / `ctest -C Debug` when applicable.
